\section{Introduction}

Elevens is a single-player card game that is played using a standard deck of fifty two cards (excluding Jokers). The objective of the game is to clear a board of nine cards by forming pairs that add up to eleven.

The game begins with a set of cards placed face up on the board. The board should have 9 cards at the start of the game. The player's task is to select cards from the board (to make a play) and form pairs that add up to eleven. For example, a player can select a five and a six, or a three and an eight. When a pair is formed, the cards are removed from the board. The player can also play a Jack, Queen, and King, in which case, all three cards will be removed. Cards are drawn from the shuffled deck to replace. The player wins when there are no more cards left in the deck, but if there are no valid plays before that, the player loses.
